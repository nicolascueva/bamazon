_This is an Amazon-like storefront using MySQL and living on our terminal. The app will take in orders from customers and deplete stock from the store's inventory._

After downloading the necessary NPM packages and creating a copy of my database you can use node to get started. First the database will display the products you can choose from, including their price. You will select one by ID and then specify the amount. Next the database will check if there is sufficient inventory. If there is then your total cost will be returned and the database inventory will update. If there is not sufficient inventory then you will get an error message.
